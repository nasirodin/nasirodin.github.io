My name is Nasirodin Mazrooei (the guy who smiles on the left).

I started my career as a software engineer after graduating with a master's in software engineering from the University of Kashan in 2013.

Currently, I'm working in [Dotin](https://www.dotin.ir/) software corporation as a back-end developer. at Dotin we mainly focused on developing software solutions for financial institutes (Core banking systems, Payments solutions, ERP Systems, ... ). as a back-end developer in the ERP team, my role generally sums up to designing and developing databases and services using .Net stack(C#, SQL server, ...).

Recently I've been joined [BIMLOGiQ](http://bimlogiq.com/) as a part-time BIM developer. a rapid-growing startup providing AI solutions for the construction industry. Utilizing Revit-API we develop plugins for Autodesk Revit to automate various stages of design and documentation tasks to increase efficiency and reduce human errors.
